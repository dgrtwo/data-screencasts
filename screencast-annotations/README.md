The summary statistics are then used to answer how would we could predict if a player will win in 2019 using `geom_point` and `logistic regression`. Initially, David wanted to predict performance based on players first year performance. (NOTE - David mistakingly grouped by `year` and `age`. He cathces this around 1:02:00.) |

| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |     [7:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=470s) | Use `fct_reorder` from the `forcats` package to reorder `title` factor levels by sorting along the `sales` variable in `geom_col` plot.                                                                                                                                |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |     [8:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=490s) | Use `labels = dollar` from the `scales` package to format the `geom_col` x-axis values as currency.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |    [11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=675s) | Use `rename_all(str_to_lower)` to convert variable names to lowercase.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |    [12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=765s) | Use `unnest_tokens` from the `tidytext` package to split the lyrics into one-lyric-per-row.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |    [13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=780s) | Use `anti_join` from the `tidytext` package to find the most common words int he lyrics without `stop_words`.                                                                                                                                                          |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |    [15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=915s) | Use `bind_tf_idf` from the `tidytext` package to determine `tf` - the proportion each word has in each album and `idf` - how specific each word is to each particular album.                                                                                           |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |   [17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=1065s) | Use `reorder_within` with `scale_y_reordered` in order to reorder the bars within each `facet panel`. David replaces `top_n` with `slice_max` from the `dplyr` package in order to show the top 10 words with `ties = FALSE`.                                          |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |   [20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=1245s) | Use `bind_log_odds` from the `tidylo` package to calculate the `log odds ratio` of album and words, that is how much more common is the word in a specific album than across all the other albums.                                                                     |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |   [23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=1390s) | Use `filter(str_length(word) <= 3)` to come up with a list in order to remove common filler words like `ah`, `uh`, `ha`, `ey`, `eeh`, and `huh`.                                                                                                                       |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |   [27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=1620s) | Use `mdy` from the `lubridate` package and `str_remove(released, " \\(.*)"))` from the `stringr` package to parse the dates in the `released` variable.                                                                                                                |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |   [28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=1695s) | Use `inner_join` from the `dplyr` package to join `taylor_swift_words` with `release_dates`. David ends up having to use `fct_recode` since the albums `reputation` and `folklore` were nor `lowercase` in a previous table thus excluding them from the `inner_join`. |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |   [28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=1710s) | Use `fct_reorder` from the `forcats` package to reorder `album` factor levels by sorting along the `released` variable to be used in the `faceted` `geom_col`.                                                                                                         |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |   [34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=2080s) | Use `bind_rows` from hte `dplyr` package to bind `ts` with `beyonce` with `unnest_tokens` from the `tidytext` package to get one lyric per row per artist.                                                                                                             |

| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |   [41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=2470s) | Use `slice_max` from the `dplyr` package to select the top 100 words by `num_words_total` and then the top 25 by `log_odds_weighted`. Results are used to create a diverging bar chart showing which words are most common between Beyonce and Taylor Swift songs.     |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |   [44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=2680s) | Use `scale_x_continuous` to make the `log_odds_weighted` scale more interpretable.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |   [50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=3045s) | Take the previous plot and turn it into a `lollipop graph` with `geom_point(aes(size = num_words_total, color = direction))`                                                                                                                                           |
| Beyonce and Taylor Swift Lyrics |   [53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYbDyfv_v4Q&t=3185s) | Use `ifelse` to change the `1x` value on the x-axis to `same`.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| NCAA Women's Basketball |  [16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RD8GNCNsCk&t=995s) | Use `geom_tile` from the `ggplot2` package to create a `heatmap` to show how far a particular seed ends up going in the tournament.                                                              |
| NCAA Women's Basketball | [20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RD8GNCNsCk&t=1235s) | Use `scale_y_continuous` from the `ggplot2` package with `breaks = seq(1, 16)` in order to include all 16 seeds.                                                                                 |
| NCAA Women's Basketball | [20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RD8GNCNsCk&t=1255s) | Use `geom_text` from the `ggplot2` package with `label = percent(pct)` to apply the percentage to each tile in the heatmap.                                                                      |
| NCAA Women's Basketball | [21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RD8GNCNsCk&t=1300s) | Use `scale_x_discrete` and `scale_y_continuous` both with `expand = c(0, 0)` to remove the space between the x and y axis and the heatmap tiles. David calls this flattening.                    |
