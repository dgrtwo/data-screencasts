```

### Exploration of the winners

```{r}
grand_slams %>%
  count(name, grand_slam, sort = TRUE) %>%
  add_count(name, wt = n) %>%
  filter(nn >= 8) %>%
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, n, sum)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(name, n, fill = grand_slam)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "# of Grand Slam tournaments won",
       title = "Tennis players with the most Grand Slam tournament wins",
       subtitle = "1968-Present",
       fill = "Grand Slam")
```

```{r}
grand_slams_age <- player_dob %>%
  select(name, date_of_birth) %>%
  inner_join(grand_slams, by = "name") %>%
  mutate(age = as.numeric(difftime(tournament_date, date_of_birth, unit = "days")) / 365.25)

grand_slams_age %>%
  ggplot(aes(age)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

The median age of a Grand Slam winner (1968-Present) is `r median(grand_slams_age$age)`. Does it differ between men and women?

```{r}
grand_slams_age %>%
  ggplot(aes(age, fill = gender)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", alpha = .75)

grand_slams_age %>%
  mutate(decade = 10 * (year(tournament_date) %/% 10)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(decade, age, fill = gender, group = interaction(gender, decade))) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Hard to make a conclusion on the average age of a winner, except it looks like it's increased in the last decade. 

```{r age_over_time}
by_decade_gender <- grand_slams_age %>%
  mutate(decade = 10 * (year(tournament_date) %/% 10)) %>%
  filter(decade >= 1970) %>%
  group_by(decade, gender, name) %>%
  summarize(age = mean(age),
            wins = n()) %>%
  summarize(age = mean(age),
            players = n())
```

```{r}
by_decade_gender %>%
  ggplot(aes(decade, age, color = gender)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Average age of Grand Slam winners over time",
       subtitle = "Each player was counted only once per decade",
       x = "Decade",
       y = "Average age",
       color = "")
```
