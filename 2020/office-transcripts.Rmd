### Transcripts

### Machine learning model

What affects popularity of an episode:

* Season/time
* Director
* Writer
* Lines per character

```{r}

  group_by(character) %>%
  filter(sum(n) >= 50,
         n() >= 5) %>%
  inner_join(ratings_summarized, by = "name")

character_lines_ratings %>%
  summarize(avg_rating = mean(imdb_rating),
            nb_episodes = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_rating)) %>%
  View()
```

```{r}
